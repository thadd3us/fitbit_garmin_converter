A comprehensive Python3 API wrapper for Garmin Connect, providing access to health, fitness, and device data.

## 📖 About

This library enables developers to programmatically access Garmin Connect data including:

- **Health Metrics**: Heart rate, sleep, stress, body composition, SpO2, HRV
- **Activity Data**: Workouts, exercises, training status, performance metrics
- **Device Information**: Connected devices, settings, alarms, solar data
- **Goals & Achievements**: Personal records, badges, challenges, race predictions
- **Historical Data**: Trends, progress tracking, date range queries

Compatible with all Garmin Connect accounts. See <https://connect.garmin.com/>

## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install garminconnect
```

## Run demo software (recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv --copies
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pdm
pdm install --group :example

# Run the simple example
python3 ./example.py

# Run the comprehensive demo
python3 ./demo.py
```


## 🛠️ Development

Set up a development environment for contributing:

> **Note**: This project uses [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/) for modern Python dependency management and task automation. All development tasks are configured as PDM scripts in `pyproject.toml`. The Python interpreter is automatically configured to use `.venv/bin/python` when you create the virtual environment.

**Environment Setup:**

> **⚠️ Important**: On externally-managed Python environments (like Debian/Ubuntu), you must create a virtual environment before installing PDM to avoid system package conflicts.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv --copies
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install PDM (Python Dependency Manager)
pip install pdm

# 3. Install all development dependencies
pdm install --group :all

# 4. Install optional tools for enhanced development experience
pip install "black[jupyter]" codespell pre-commit

# 5. Setup pre-commit hooks (optional)
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

**Alternative for System-wide PDM Installation:**
```bash
# Install PDM via pipx (recommended for system-wide tools)
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install pdm

# Then proceed with project setup
pdm install --group :all
```

**Available Development Commands:**
```bash
pdm run format      # Auto-format code (isort, black, ruff --fix)
pdm run lint        # Check code quality (isort, ruff, black, mypy)
pdm run codespell   # Check spelling errors (install codespell if needed)
pdm run test        # Run test suite
pdm run testcov     # Run tests with coverage report
pdm run all         # Run all checks
pdm run clean      # Clean build artifacts and cache files
pdm run build      # Build package for distribution
pdm run publish    # Build and publish to PyPI
```

**View all available commands:**
```bash
pdm run --list     # Display all available PDM scripts
```

**Code Quality Workflow:**
```bash
# Before making changes
pdm run lint       # Check current code quality

# After making changes
pdm run format     # Auto-format your code
pdm run lint       # Verify code quality
pdm run codespell  # Check spelling
pdm run test       # Run tests to ensure nothing broke
```

Run these commands before submitting PRs to ensure code quality standards.

## 🔐 Authentication

The library uses the same OAuth authentication as the official Garmin Connect app via [Garth](https://github.com/matin/garth).

**Key Features:**
- Login credentials valid for one year (no repeated logins)
- Secure OAuth token storage
- Same authentication flow as official app

**Advanced Configuration:**
```python
# Optional: Custom OAuth consumer (before login)
import os
import garth
garth.sso.OAUTH_CONSUMER = {
    'key': os.getenv('GARTH_OAUTH_KEY', '<YOUR_KEY>'),
    'secret': os.getenv('GARTH_OAUTH_SECRET', '<YOUR_SECRET>'),
}
# Note: Set these env vars securely; placeholders are non-sensitive.
```

**Token Storage:**
Tokens are automatically saved to `~/.garminconnect` directory for persistent authentication.
For security, ensure restrictive permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.garminconnect
chmod 600 ~/.garminconnect/* 2>/dev/null || true
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

**Prerequisites:**

Create tokens in ~/.garminconnect by running the example program.

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pdm install --group :all
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
pdm run test        # Run all tests
pdm run testcov     # Run tests with coverage report
```

Optional: keep test tokens isolated

```bash
export GARMINTOKENS="$(mktemp -d)"
python3 ./example.py # create fresh tokens for tests
pdm run test
```

**Note:** Tests automatically use `~/.garminconnect` as the default token file location. You can override this by setting the `GARMINTOKENS` environment variable. Run `example.py` first to generate authentication tokens for testing.

**For Developers:** Tests use VCR cassettes to record/replay HTTP interactions. If tests fail with authentication errors, ensure valid tokens exist in `~/.garminconnect`

## 📦 Publishing

For package maintainers:

**Setup PyPI credentials:**
```bash
pip install twine
# Edit with your preferred editor, or create via here-doc:
# cat > ~/.pypirc <<'EOF'
# [pypi]
# username = __token__
# password = <PyPI_API_TOKEN>
# EOF
```
```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <PyPI_API_TOKEN>
```

Recommended: use environment variables and restrict file perms

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
export TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"
export TWINE_PASSWORD="<PyPI_API_TOKEN>"
```

**Publish new version:**
```bash
pdm run publish    # Build and publish to PyPI
```

**Alternative publishing steps:**
```bash
pdm run build      # Build package only
pdm publish        # Publish pre-built package
```
